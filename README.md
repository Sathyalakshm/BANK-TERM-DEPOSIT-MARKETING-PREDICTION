# BANK-TERM-DEPOSIT-MARKETING-PREDICTION

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed.

Dataset have 17 attributes (7 numerical attributes & 10 categorical attributes)including one dependent attribute and there are 45211 instances/datapoints. So we have 16 predictor/independent attributes and 1 dependent attribute.

**Features:**  Age, job, marital, education, defaulted credit, balance, housing loan, Other loan, contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome, y(has the client subscribed a term deposit?)

**OBJECTIVE**
 To find the best model with a high accuracy rate to predict if the client contacted through the marketing campaign will subscribe a term deposit.

** Steps:**
Perform basic EDA
